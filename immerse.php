<h1>Immerse</h1>

<p>
  I designed a travel, culture and style magazine from concept to finish.
  Immerse is a bi-annual publication that features one city per issue, using
  engaging, curated photography and articles to provide the reader with an
  immersive urban experience.

<h2>Article Layout</h2>

<p>
  The readers of this magazine are interested in the unique style of their
  favorite cities, so I used bold imagery to capture the essence of the city and
  tell it’s story to the reader with quiet typography to let the content stand
  on it’s own. In this article, the reader is drawn into the story of how Tokyo
  rebuilt itself after WWII as the photos turn from monochromatic to full color
  to represent the growth into the vibrant city it is today.

    <h2>Sections</h2>
    <p>
      The magazine is separated into three sections: travel, culture and style.
      These sections each offer a unique perspective through in-depth articles
      and photography. I art directed custom photo shoots for the section
      spreads to set the tone of each of the sections.

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>
  The process of creating this magazine began with researching readers who would
  be interested in a different type of travel magazine. After discovering a gap
  in the market for a city based magazine, I started thinking about what kind of
  content readers would want about their favorite city and ended up with three
  main sections: travel, culture &amp; style. From there I created a flatplan to
  layout the structure of the magazine.

    <h2>Guide Map</h2>
    <p>
      I included a guide map with custom iconography to represent spots
      mentioned in the magazine. This guide map is a perfect companion to the
      magazine and designed for the traveler who is more than a tourist.

  <h2>Online Magazine</h2>
  <p>
    I created an online version of the magazine to showcase the voice of the
    Immerse brand through a digital format. Using similar layouts and focus on
    content, the website shows how the publication would reach a broader audience.
