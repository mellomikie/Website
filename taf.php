<h1>Texas Art &amp; Film</h1>

<p>
  Texas Art &amp; Film is an online film editorial publication for film reviews
  and film festival coverage. It needed a UX redesign and branding overhaul. The
  research required organizing large amounts of content and strategizing to make
  it accessible to a wide demographic using new features and adding a social
  media strategy.

<p>
  Texas Art &amp; Film is primarily a resource for finding online film reviews.
  My research showed that the majority of users who are looking for reviews on
  film access the site on a mobile device, so I designed a layout that gave
  users easy access to the latest film reviews, provided them with easy mobile
  sharing options and offered the ability to comment and join in the
  conversation about their favorite films.

<h2>Event Campaigns</h2>

<p>
  I create custom content for site events, including yearly Oscars campaigns
  featuring printable ballots, custom page designs, HTML email campaigns and
  traffic driving graphics to promote the events.

    <h2>Content Management</h2>
    <p>
      I organized years of festival coverage into a film festival section that
      offers various types of content including video interviews, film reviews,
      and articles about the festival.

  <div id="visit">
    <a href="http://www.texasartfilm.net">Visit Site</a>
  </div>

  <p>
    After analyzing the content and user research, I designed the final layout of
    the site to offer custom banners that show the user what is new on the site,
    give quick access to the latest film reviews and provide film festival
    coverage as well as awards coverage. After the redesign, user traffic
    increased by 150%.
