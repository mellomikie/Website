<h1>Anne Douglass Therapy</h1>

<p>
  Anne Douglass is a mental health therapist in Seattle who needed branding for
  her growing business. I designed a brand system and logo that works across
  print and digital and redesigned her website.

<p>
  The logo was designed to express Anneâ€™s personality, feel approachable to
  new clients and have the personal touch of a signature. I collaborated with
  Ana Raab for photography used on the brochure and website.

<div id="website">
  <img src="images/anne/annedouglasswebsite.jpg" alt="Website" />
  <a class="link-box" href="http://annedouglasstherapy.com">Visit Site</a>
  <p>
    I designed the website with the user in mind. Potential clients want to see
    the therapist they are considering so I made Anne the focal point of the
    site, providing important information and a method of contact at all times.
    The color palette and imagery is relaxing and approachable.
